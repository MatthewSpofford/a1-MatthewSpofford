This project shows how to create a basic webpage using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This involved creating a basic HTML layout, stylizing it with some basic CSS attributes, as well as creating some basic functions/animations with Javascript.

## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for h1, h2, h3, p & li, as well as multiple ::after pseudo selectors for the *none*, *some*, and *a lot* list items.

- **Implemented constants for accessing color pallet**: Each of the colors that I created with my color wheel were saved in constants in my *body* CSS selector.

- **Created animation with JavaScript**: 

- **Used different HTML tags**: img, table, a, div, tr, th, and td.

- **Added support for external CSS/JS**: The server.js script now is capable of accessing the new index.css, and index.js when they are requested by the browser. The browser requests the file due to the CSS/JS file being mentioned correctly in index.html. This was a challenge, because I needed to actually decipher how the server.js file functions.

### Design Achievements

- **Created custom color pallet**: Pallet values can be found at the top of the CSS file. Based on this color wheel: ![color wheel](color_wheel.png)
This was a challenge because it was difficult to find an appealing color pallet to use, as well as find what elements to apply it to.

- **Used font from Google fonts**: Used the [Staatliches](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Staatliches?sort=popularity) font in my CSS file. This was a challenge, as I needed to find out how to access the font and add it to my style sheet, as well as how to then add the font to my selectors.
